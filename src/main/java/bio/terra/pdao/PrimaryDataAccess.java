/**
 * In the long term, we want to make the primary data store be pluggable, supporting different implementations.
 * This interface documents what that pluggable interface might look like. Of course, we never know until we
 * build another one.
 *
 * We use the term "container" for the object that contains a set of tables. In BigQuery, this would be a
 * BigQuery dataset. In Postgresql, it would probably be a schema.
 *
 * The expected sequence of calls to ensure idempotence:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>do sequence</li>
 *     <ol>
 *         <li>studyExists - validate that the study does not exist before calling create</li>
 *         <li>createStudy - if it finds the study, it deletes it and recreates. That covers the case where the
 *         create operation is interrupted by a service failure and restarts.</li>
 *     </ol>
 *     <li>undo</li>
 *     <ol>
 *         <li>deleteStudy - called on undo; does not fail if the study has already been deleted</li>
 *     </ol>
 * </ul>
 *
 * All implementation-specific exceptions should be caught by the implementation and wrapped
 * in PdaoException.

      remarks: |
        A row's presence in the `load` table indicates that the combination of load tag and dataset
        are currently locked.
        The presence of a `locked` column (whose value was always true) along with the table name
        did not make this behavior clear.
      changes:
        - dropColumn:
            tableName: load
            columnName: locked
        - renameTable:
            oldTableName: load
            newTableName: load_lock

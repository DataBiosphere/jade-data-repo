              Build the dataset_bucket table. This will find all buckets allocated from the same project
              as the dataset. However, if there are buckets used by the dataset in other projects, this
              will not find them. In fact, there is no path using just the metadata database to locate them,
              which is why this table is needed.
            sql: >
              INSERT INTO dataset_bucket (dataset_id, bucket_resource_id, successful_ingests)
              SELECT dataset.id, bucket_resource.id, 1
              FROM dataset, bucket_resource, project_resource
              WHERE dataset.default_profile_id = project_resource.profile_id
              AND bucket_resource.project_resource_id = project_resource.id

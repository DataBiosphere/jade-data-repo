  title: Data Repository API
  description: >
    <details><summary>This document defines the REST API for the Terra Data Repository.</summary>
    <p>
    **Status: design in progress**

    There are a few top-level endpoints (besides some used by swagger):
     * / - generated by swagger: swagger API page that provides this
    documentation and a live UI for submitting REST requests
     * /status - provides the operational status of the service
     * /configuration - provides the basic configuration and information about the service
     * /api - is the authenticated and authorized Data Repository API
     * /ga4gh/drs/v1 - is a transcription of the Data Repository Service API

    The API endpoints are organized by interface. Each interface is separately versioned.
    <p>
    **Notes on Naming**
    <p>
    All of the reference items are suffixed with \"Model\".
    Those names are used as the class names in the generated Java code.
    It is helpful to distinguish these model classes from other related classes, like the DAO classes and the operation classes.

            If true, for GCP-backed datasets, a service account will be created in the dataset's primary GCP project.
            This service account must be granted `storage.objects.get` permissions on any source buckets that TDR will ingest data from.
            The service account can be obtained when retrieving the dataset.  If this value is false and the dataset
            is a GCP-backed dataset, then the global service account must be granted `storage.objects.get` permissions to source buckets.

            Note: this can be done by granting the "Storage Object Viewer", "Storage Legacy Object Reader", or "Storage Legacy Object Owner"
            role to the source buckets

            This might be useful to set as a security improvement since this provides a dedicated account that explicitly
            does not have access to any other buckets.  It's also recommended if you need to authorize a large number of buckets
            since the main service account could run into Google group membership quota violations.

                         will fail. Note: the full new record must be specified.
             * `merge` - If a primary key is present on the table, treat rows with matching primary keys
                         as partial updates. Any fields specified will overwrite their current values
                         in the matching table row.  Each ingest row must match exactly one table row,

        Request for creating a snapshot.
        For now, the API only supports snapshots defined as a single dataset asset and
        row ids for the root table of that asset. The snapshot has exactly the tables
        and columns of the asset. An optional list of users can be provided to set as
        readers on the snapshot.
        In the future, we will need to extend this to handle cross-dataset snapshots
        from disparate assets, so we will need to support column and datatype
        mapping from asset tables to the target snapshot tables.

            A counted fault is used to insert some number of faults in a pattern. See the

      description: >
        Counted fault is used to insert a fixed number of faults. A "fault test" is one
        call to the fault manager for a named fault. The skipFor lets you get the system to
        a certain stable point where you want to begin inserting faults. Insert gives the
        total number of faults to trigger. The rate gives the percentage of the time to
        insert the fault. A value of 50 would insert the fault half
        the time. A value of 20 would insert the fault 20% of the time . The rateStyle
        describes whether the fault will be fixed or random. In our 20 example, if the rate style
        is fixed, the fault would be skipped 4 times, inserted once, skipped 4 times, inserted once, etc.
        It uses integer math - you've been warned. If the rate style is random, a random number
        is generated to determine whether the fault is inserted with a probability of 0.2.

            The checksum of the `Object`. At least one checksum must be provided.
            For blobs, the checksum is computed over the bytes in the blob.

            For bundles, the checksum is computed over a sorted concatenation of the checksums of its top-level contained objects (not recursive, names not included). The list of checksums is sorted alphabetically (hex-code) before concatenation and a further checksum is performed on the concatenated checksum value.

            For example, if a bundle contains blobs with the following checksums:
            md5(blob1) = 72794b6d
            md5(blob2) = 5e089d29

            Then the checksum of the bundle is:
            md5( concat( sort( md5(blob1), md5(blob2) ) ) )
            = md5( concat( sort( 72794b6d, 5e089d29 ) ) )

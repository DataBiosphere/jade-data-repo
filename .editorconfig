# IntelliJ will automatically detect this file in the top level directory and customize
# its code style based on the rules below.

# EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working
# on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists
# of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins
# that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles.
# EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.

  title: Data Repository API
  description: >
    This document defines the REST API for Data Repository.
    **Status: design in progress**

    There are four top-level endpoints (besides some used by swagger):
     * /swagger-ui.html - generated by swagger: swagger API page that provides this documentation and a live UI for
         submitting REST requests
     * /status - provides the operational status of the service
     * /api    - is the authenticated and authorized Data Repository API
     * /ga4gh/drs/v1 - is a transcription of the Data Repository Service API

    The overall API (/api) currently supports two interfaces:
     * Repository - a general and default interface for initial setup, managing ingest and repository metadata
     * Resource - an interface for managing billing accounts and resources

    The API endpoints are organized by interface. Each interface is separately versioned.

    ## Notes on Naming
    All of the reference items are suffixed with "Model". Those names are used as the class names in the generated Java
    code. It is helpful to distinguish these model classes from other related classes, like the DAO classes and the
    operation classes.

    ## Editing and debugging
    I have found it best to edit this file directly to make changes and then use the swagger-editor to validate. The
    errors out of swagger-codegen are not that helpful. In the swagger-editor, it gives you nice errors and links to
    the place in the YAML where the errors are.

    But... the swagger-editor has been a bit of a pain for me to run. I tried the online website and was not able to
    load my YAML. Instead, I run it locally in a docker container, like this:
    ```
    docker pull swaggerapi/swagger-editor
    docker run -p 9090:8080 swaggerapi/swagger-editor
    ```
    Then navigate to localhost:9090 in your browser.

    I have not been able to get the file upload to work. It is a bit of a PITA, but I copy-paste the source code,
    replacing what is in the editor. Then make any fixes. Then copy-paste the resulting, valid file back into our source
    code. Not elegant, but easier than playing detective with the swagger-codegen errors.

    This might be something about my browser or environment, so give it a try yourself and see how it goes.

    ## Merging the DRS standard swagger into this swagger ##

    The merging is done in three sections:
     1. Merging the security definitions into our security definitions
     2. This section of paths. We make all paths explicit (prefixed with /ga4gh/drs/v1)
        All standard DRS definitions and parameters are prefixed with 'DRS' to separate them
        from our native definitions and parameters. We remove the x-swagger-router-controller lines.
     3. A separate part of the definitions section for the DRS definitions

    NOTE: the code here does not relect the DRS spec anymore. See DR-409.

        and columns of the asset. An optional list of users can be provided to set as

        In the future, we will need to extend this to handle cross-dataset snapshots
        from disparate assets, so we will need to support column and datatype
        mapping from asset tables to the target snapshot tables.

      description: >
        Counted fault is used to insert a fixed number of faults. A "fault test" is one
        call to the fault manager for a named fault. The skipFor lets you get the system to
        a certain stable point where you want to begin inserting faults. Insert gives the
        total number of faults to trigger. The rate gives the percentage of the time to
        insert the fault. A value of 50 would insert the fault half
        the time. A value of 20 would insert the fault 20% of the time . The rateStyle
        describes whether the fault will be fixed or random. In our 20 example, if the rate style
        is fixed, the fault would be skipped 4 times, inserted once, skipped 4 times, inserted once, etc.
        It uses integer math - you've been warned. If the rate style is random, a random number
        is generated to determine whether the fault is inserted with a probability of 0.2.

            For blobs, the checksum is computed over the bytes in the blob.

            For bundles, the checksum is computed over a sorted concatenation of the checksums of its top-level contained objects (not recursive, names not included). The list of checksums is sorted alphabetically (hex-code) before concatenation and a further checksum is performed on the concatenated checksum value.

            For example, if a bundle contains blobs with the following checksums:
            md5(blob1) = 72794b6d
            md5(blob2) = 5e089d29

            Then the checksum of the bundle is:
            md5( concat( sort( md5(blob1), md5(blob2) ) ) )
            = md5( concat( sort( 72794b6d, 5e089d29 ) ) )

      remarks: |
        On table creation, we made the DUOS dataset ID our sole primary key, and got uniqueness
        protection for free as a result.
        But we prefer to mint a surrogate primary key to guard against the possibility that
        DUOS IDs could be renamed or otherwise represented differently in the future.
        As we still want to guard against having multiple rows with the same DUOS ID,
        we must add a uniqueness constraint to the duos_id column.
      changes:
        - dropPrimaryKey:
            tableName: duos_firecloud_group
            constraintName: duos_firecloud_group_pkey
        - addPrimaryKey:
            tableName: duos_firecloud_group
            columnNames: id
        - addUniqueConstraint:
            tableName: duos_firecloud_group
            columnNames: duos_id

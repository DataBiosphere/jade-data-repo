Some of these resource files are meant to be copies of resources in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

These resources are weakly linked: we do not enforce that file paths and/or contents match exactly
between source control and GCS.

However, the expectation is that the contents of files in GCS match the contents of these files.

To examine files in GCS, see `application-*test.properties` ingestbucket settings.

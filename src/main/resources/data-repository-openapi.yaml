# [dd] It seems like openapi 3.0 is released, but swagger-codegen does not yet support it.
# We should move to 3.0 when swagger-codegen is ready.

swagger: '2.0'
info:
  title: Data Repository API
  description: |
    This document defines the REST API for Data Repository.
    **Status: design in progress**

    There are three top-level endpoints (besides some used by swagger):
     * /       - generated by swagger: swagger API page that provides this documentation and a live UI for submitting REST requests
     * /status - provides the operational status of the service
     * /api    - is the authenticated and authorized Data Repository API

    The overall API (/api) currently supports one interface:
     * Repository - a general and default interface for initial setup

    The API endpoints are organized by interface. Each interface is separately versioned.

    ## Notes on Naming
    All of the reference items are suffixed with "Model". Those names are used as the class names in the generated Java code.
    It is helpful to distinguish these model classes from other related classes, like the DAO classes and the operation classes.

    ## Editing and debugging
    I have found it best to edit this file directly to make changes and then use the swagger-editor to validate. The errors
    out of swagger-codegen are not that helpful. In the swagger-editor, it gives you nice errors and links to the place in
    the YAML where the errors are.

    But... the swagger-editor has been a bit of a pain for me to run. I tried the online website and was not able to load my
    YAML. Instead, I run it locally in a docker container, like this:
    ```
    docker pull swaggerapi/swagger-editor
    docker run -p 9090:8080 swaggerapi/swagger-editor
    ```
    Then navigate to localhost:9090 in your browser.

    I have not been able to get the file upload to work. It is a bit of a PITA, but I copy-paste the source code,
    replacing what is in the editor. Then make any fixes. Then copy-paste the resulting, valid file back into our source
    code. Not elegant, but easier than playing detective with the swagger-codegen errors.

    This might be something about my browser or environment, so give it a try yourself and see how it goes.

      Table, column, and relationship names follow this pattern. This should be used for the name of any object in the

      any extra columns the DR adds. For table names, this is shorter than what BigQuery allows.

      and columns of the asset.
      In the future, we will need to extend this to handle cross-study datasets
      from disparate assets, so we will need to support column and datatype
      mapping from asset tables to the target dataset tables.
